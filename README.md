## What It Is
Smart Kiosk is an product for revolutionizing retail shopping experience. Harnessing the power of Internet of Things, we have developed a product solution that would dynamically change the perspective of brick and mortar shopping experience.

## How it works
Works as a personal concierge in a retail shopping store. Detects presence of customer walking into the store and keeps the store managers proactive. Gives detailed information about what customers are looking for. Provides the customer a Kiosk that detects customers presence and provides all the information related to him.

When each customer enters the store, the store manager is notified about it on his dashboard. He also is able to see the list of items the user has in his shopping/wish list. This gives the sales team an edge to be proactive in procuring items from the warehouse if they are running low in stock.
